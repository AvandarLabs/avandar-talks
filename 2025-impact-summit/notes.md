Slide Deck: “Sustainable Open Source Technology Business Models” (20–25 min)
(Designed for clarity, minimalism, and memorability — low text, strong visuals, deep speaker notes.)

⸻

Slide 1 — Title Slide

Content:
• Top Center Title: “Sustainable Open Source Technology Business Models”
• Bottom Left: “Juan Pablo Sarmiento — Impact First Summit”
• Bottom Right (small): “Avandar Labs” + Avandar logo or subtle visual mark.
• Background: abstract visual of interconnected nodes or open-source logo motif (light opacity).

Speaker Notes:
• Introduce self briefly: who I am, founder of Avandar Labs, focus on ethical tech for the social sector.
• Frame talk: open source is ethically necessary but needs to be sustainable.
• Promise: I’ll unpack the tension between openness and survival — and show models that work.

⸻

Slide 2 — The Premise

Content:
• Title (Top): “Ethics Without Sustainability Collapses.”
• Center: Big text quote style, centered.
• No bullets.
• Background: subtle texture (e.g. faint image of code or globe).

Speaker Notes:
• Start with the moral dimension: open source is not just a license, it’s a value system.
• But ethics alone doesn’t keep developers fed, servers running, or impact measurable.
• “Ethical collapse” happens when idealism outruns structure.
• Set tone: we’ll talk about ethics and pragmatism.

⸻

Slide 3 — The “Open” Triad

Content:
• Title (Top Left): “The Open Principles”
• Center: Three icons arranged horizontally with labels below each: 1. Open Standards 2. Open Data 3. Open Source
• Simple icons (e.g. plug, database, code brackets).

Speaker Notes:
• Explain each principle briefly.
• Emphasize how digital development adopted these to ensure interoperability and transparency.
• Say: “But we confused openness with non-commercialism.”

⸻

Slide 4 — The Problem

Content:
• Title: “The Dogma Problem”
• Left: Illustration of a balance scale — “Ethics” on one side, “Sustainability” on the other.
• Right: Few short bullets (large font):
• “Open = Free?”
• “Profit = Unethical?”
• “Service-only survival?”

Speaker Notes:
• Describe how many in global digital development equate open source with charity.
• Projects launch, gain praise, then die when grants dry up.
• Others swing the opposite way — they fake openness.
• Transition: “Let’s explore both extremes.”

⸻

Slide 5 — The Two Extremes

Content:
• Title: “Two Extremes, Both Broken”
• Left Column:
• Header: “Dogmatic Openness”
• Simple icon: open lock
• Subtext: “Everything must be open → Unsustainable”
• Right Column:
• Header: “Faux Openness”
• Icon: padlock disguised as open
• Subtext: “Code is open but unusable → Lock-in”

Speaker Notes:
• Dogmatic openness rejects any proprietary boundaries — great ethics, zero revenue.
• Faux openness pretends to share, but makes self-hosting impossible — unethical monetization.
• Neither approach honors the true spirit of open collaboration.
• Bridge: “So how do we move between these?”

⸻

Slide 6 — What Licensing Really Means

Content:
• Title: “Licensing = Design for Sustainability”
• Simple visual: 3 columns labeled: 1. Permissive (MIT, Apache) 2. Copyleft (GPL, AGPL) 3. Hybrid / Source-Available (SSPL, Elastic License)
• Each column has one short line under it (e.g. “Encourage reuse”, “Protect openness”, “Protect business model”).

Speaker Notes:
• Explain license families as levers for sustainability.
• Permissive maximizes adoption.
• Copyleft maximizes openness.
• Hybrid maximizes viability.
• Stress: your license is a strategic decision, not just legal paperwork.

⸻

Slide 7 — Transition to Business Models

Content:
• Center (large font): “How do open-source projects stay alive?”
• Below: smaller subtitle — “Let’s look at five proven models.”
• Background: transparent image of flow from code → users → revenue (subtle arrows).

Speaker Notes:
• Transition moment.
• Frame what’s next: five sustainable patterns that preserve both mission and margin.
• Each has real-world precedents — I’ll show one for each.

⸻

Slide 8 — Model 1: Open Core

Content:
• Title: “1. Open Core”
• Left: Minimal icon of gear with “core” highlighted.
• Right: Few words:
• “Core open-source”
• “Paid premium features”
• “Community + enterprise balance”
• Bottom Corner: Logo of Airbyte.

Speaker Notes:
• Airbyte: open-source data pipelines; open core product with paid connectors and cloud.
• Core open → community growth.
• Paid tiers → sustainable revenue and faster innovation.
• Works well for developer-centric tools.

⸻

Slide 9 — Model 2: Managed Hosting / SaaS

Content:
• Title: “2. Managed Hosting / SaaS”
• Left: Cloud icon or simple server stack illustration.
• Right:
• “Code is open”
• “Convenience is paid”
• “Trust through transparency”
• Bottom Corner: Supabase logo.

Speaker Notes:
• Supabase is fully open-source, Postgres-based alternative to Firebase.
• Users can self-host for free, or pay Supabase to manage infrastructure.
• Business model = selling time, reliability, and peace of mind.
• This aligns well with humanitarian contexts where uptime and maintenance are costly.

⸻

Slide 10 — Model 3: Support & Services

Content:
• Title: “3. Support & Services”
• Left: Simple icon of handshake or toolkit.
• Right:
• “Software free”
• “Revenue = expertise”
• Bottom Corner: ODK logo.

Speaker Notes:
• Open Data Kit: open software for data collection.
• Revenue comes from training, deployment, certification.
• Classic consulting model — effective for nonprofits with mission-aligned tech.
• Works when your clients value local capacity building as much as the code.

⸻

Slide 11 — Model 4: Dual Licensing

Content:
• Title: “4. Dual Licensing”
• Left: Split icon — two documents side by side.
• Right:
• “Open license (GPL)”
• “Commercial license for proprietary use”
• Bottom Corner: MySQL logo.

Speaker Notes:
• MySQL pioneered this: open GPL for general users, commercial license for companies embedding it in closed systems.
• Enables free community growth and commercial sustainability simultaneously.
• Useful when others want to integrate your code in closed environments.

⸻

Slide 12 — Model 5: Hybrid

Content:
• Title: “5. Hybrid”
• Left: Docker whale icon (or schematic whale illustration).
• Right:
• “Fully open core”
• “Proprietary but free tools (Docker Desktop)”
• “Revenue from subscriptions & cloud”

Speaker Notes:
• Docker is open source, but monetizes through Docker Hub and subscriptions, not paywalls.
• Proprietary tools enhance experience but remain free — trust maintained.
• Good model for balancing broad community adoption with commercial viability.

⸻

Slide 13 — Ethical Playbook

Content:
• Title: “The Ethical Playbook”
• Five Short Bullets (centered): 1. Be explicit. 2. License intentionally. 3. Ensure deployability. 4. Price transparently. 5. Share governance.

Speaker Notes:
• Each bullet becomes a principle.
• “Be explicit”: state what’s open and why.
• “License intentionally”: choose to sustain, not react.
• “Ensure deployability”: avoid open-washing.
• “Price transparently”: people will pay if they understand the why.
• “Share governance”: openness is about participation, not just code access.

⸻

Slide 14 — Bringing It Together

Content:
• Title: “Ethics + Sustainability = Durable Openness”
• Visual: Simple equation graphic across the slide (large).
• No bullet points.
• Background: subtle gradient, calm color.

Speaker Notes:
• Summarize the synthesis: open and sustainable aren’t opposites.
• Durability — not purity — is what makes openness ethical.
• Reiterate that this balance builds trust and longevity.

⸻

Slide 15 — Closing

Content:
• Center (Large Font): “Openness must be durable to be ethical.”
• Below: “Thank you.”
• Bottom: optional QR code or link to Avandar Labs / contact info.

Speaker Notes:
• End with this single line; let it sit.
• Invite reflection and questions.
• Optional transition into discussion about how the digital development community can adopt these practices sector-wide.

⸻

(End of Presentation — Q&A optional slide could simply display the Avandar logo or an open circle animation with the word “Questions?” centered.)
